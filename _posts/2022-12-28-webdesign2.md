# Lesson from Web Building so far...
I am not web designer, I am awful at it, but I am learning, happily at that. Recently I wrote a very lengthy post, and wanted to add a sidebar containing the table of contents to make it easier to navigate. In my attempt to do this, I learned that it was not very straightforward, I googled "adding side bar to github pages", and read majority of the posts, the consensus was that using generic [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) does not really allow for it and we should use a different theme (template) that comes ready made with navigation sidebar.

And like many other newbies of web building, I used the bare minimum theme made by GitHub pages by following its instructions. The minimal design is great and what is even better is that we are free to customise beyond it, which is what I ended up doing with my

# Centering things (anything and everything?)

I have learned so far that when it comes to building websites, there's two main components, HTML and CSS. You need HTML to define a lot of the skeleton of the website, and it involves a lot of `< >`. And with it we can do a lot of things, including centering, but we need to be mindful that text and other objects are different. For example for most things, we can add 'center' to the `class` within a tag, but for texts, we need to make use of 'text-center'.

Beyond that, CSS styling can help customise the website beyond HTML, for example on centering, we can use the following should HTML centering fail (I don't know why it fails). 

{% raw %}
```css
.center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
``` 
{% endraw %}

# Making sure css works
{% raw %}
We can customise plenty of things using css, and its all stored within a `.css` file, which we just have to _include_ (import) at the start of every website, which is can conveniently be done with a `header.html` that we can 'import' using jekyll liquid `{% include header.html %}` at the start. Within `header.html`, we can import the css styling as such (replace the "styles.css" location and file name as needed):


```html
<head>
    ... 
    <link href="{{ "/assets/styles.css" | relative_url }}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
```
{% endraw %}
