# Adding Table of Contents Sidebar to Github Pages (Posts)




# Lessons from Web Building so far
I have learned so far that when it comes to building websites, there's two main components, HTML and CSS. You need HTML to define a lot of the skeleton of the website, and it involves a lot of `< >`. And with it we can do a lot of things, including centering, but we need to be mindful that text and other objects are different. For example for most things, we can add 'center' to the `class` within a tag, but for texts, we need to make use of 'text-center'.

Beyond that, CSS styling can help customise the website beyond HTML, for example on centering, we can use the following should HTML centering fail (I don't know why it fails). 

```css
.center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
``` 

But basically, we can customise plenty of things using css, and its all stored within a `.css` file, which we just have to _include_ (import) at the start of every website, which is can conveniently be done with a `header.html` that we can 'import' using jekyll liquid `{% include header.html %}` at the start. Within `header.html`, we can import the css styling as such (replace the styles.css location and file name as needed):

```html
<head>
    ... <!-- everything else here -->
    <link href="{{ "/assets/styles.css" | relative_url }}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
```
