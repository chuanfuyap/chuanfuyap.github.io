tldr; implementation of different ML models in python and their performance on the Cat vs Dog dataset.

# Introduction
Not all models are created equal, and not all models are created for the same purpose. This post will be a whirlwind tour of different machine learning models and their performance on the Cat vs Dog dataset. The models that will be covered are:
