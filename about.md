title: About Me
---

I am half biologist, half programmer and half statistician, that makes me 1.5 scientist.. wait a minute.... 

Formally I am a researcher at a university, but informally I am just someone who enjoys learning new things and solving problems. Being a researcher, I am given the opportunity to do both, where I have to study and/or solve a problem, and most of the time in order to do so, I am required to learn new things, either technical methods or the background knowledge necessary. I aspire to be someone that can solve (almost) any problem using computer and mathematics. 

Below is my resume summary.

## Research Experience
#### Genetics and Genomics Research, 2021-Present
Bioinformatics analysis on various high-throughput sequencing output, such as genomics and transcriptomics in context of Rheumatoid Arthritis
#### Metagenomics Research, 2019-2021
Studied metagenomics of lung microbiome in context of asthma using mathematical, statistical and machine learning models. Various scripts for data processing and analysis was turned into a python package, [motupy](https://github.com/chuanfuyap/motu-python-package)
#### Kinetic Modelling of Cell Metabolism,  2014-2018  
This was my PhD work where I optimised ODE models of yeast cell metabolism using genetic algorithm. [Convenient Modeller](https://github.com/chuanfuyap/Convenient-Modeller) was developed as part of this work.
